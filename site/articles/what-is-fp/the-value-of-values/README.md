# The Value of Values (What is FP?)

A principle in functional programming is to discuss _values_ (sometimes called _canonical forms_). Values are inert, final and therefore can be entirely characterized by their structure. By making them the basis of how we talk about programs we take great steps to achieving our goal of simplicity.
