# Articles

Thoughts, techniques, reports, and updates from Well Conditioned.

- [The tension between values and computation](./plt/values-and-computation/)
  discusses how a language can intensify the difference between static data and
  dynamic computation to make one of the fundamental tensions of programming
  more clear.

- [Theories and models](./plt/theories-and-models/) gives a toolkit for thinking
  about abstraction in the form of _theories_ and _models_ and their interplay.
  This article introduces this idea which shows up again and again and again in
  mathematics, language design, and software craft.

<!--

- Equality is hard (and also everything)
- Frank, on separating values and computation

- What should we learn from Category Theory?
- Simplicity, again
- Data-Focused programming

- Building programs from _Theories_

## What is functional programming?

A series of articles on the values, principles, and consequent practices of functional programming. This series is written as an alternative answer to the titular question that doesn't try to draw a bright line around any set of fashionable techniques or languages.

- [Overview](./what-is-fp/)
- [Simplicity](./what-is-fp/simplicity/)
- [Creation and Analysis](./what-is-fp/creation-and-analysis/)
- [The Value of Values](./what-is-fp/the-value-of-values/)
- [Theory Over Analogy](./what-is-fp/theory-over-analogy/)
